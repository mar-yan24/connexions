<p> After talking to a friend about studying and school, he said: "Part of the problem is that society and schools are very individually centered. It’s all about making “me” the best I can be. “Me” the best athlete. “Me” the best academic. Make myself the best person in the world. But life doesn’t work like that - when you get a job, you are on a team. The education doesn't fully replicate the basics of working society." As students ourselves, we also realized that there are points in life where we struggle to complete a project. This one thought that someone could have given us could have made or broke the good grade students need.
  </p>
<p>The person mentioned earlier, also recommened that I could put this idea into a website. As the hackathon progressed, I had already implemented some of his thoughts and "solutions" into our project.</p>

  Juniors/Seniors can use this site to look for colleges by uploading their grades, GPA, and other such information. Other students, by using that information they can look for tutors/someone to help them with their work. Juniors and Seniors can use this site for help as well.
</p>
<p> This is a way where could have a mass "peer editing." This is also an opportunity where others can go to a specific topic and obtain help. After talking to a few friends, we realized that this is a way where we can help students who are having a writer's block (or a similar type of thing) get help to push through it.

  We do not support plagarism nor having people actually do work for you. We also do not support bullying, harassment, or any other type of harmful acts. This is just a safe place where people can receive help, grow, and understand their work further.

How does it work?</div> <div class="content_section_text"> 
<p>What this site does is it allows for people to look at a certain topic and to go into this "database" to gain inspiration, help, and other such materials. We do not, however, support plagarism. </p>
<p>What you can do is to "go" to a certain topic page, and receive help by posting things (i.e. a question or a part of your essay you want comments on). This is also where you can get inspiration for whatever you might be working on.</p>

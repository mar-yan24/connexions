# connexions

Our project, Connexions, is a project focused around student to student learning and communication. One big thing that students, especially new ones, struggle with is often managing different aspects of school, such as a social life, good grades, and sleep. 

The Connexions project aims to fix some of those problems by combining them into one. For example, one thing that our project originally was aimed to do was to focus student to student learning and teaching fostering both a sense of kinnship as well as academic growth.
